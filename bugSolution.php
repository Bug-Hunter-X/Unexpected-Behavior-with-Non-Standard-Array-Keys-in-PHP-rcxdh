The most effective solution is to always use string or integer keys for your PHP arrays.  This ensures predictable and consistent behavior. If you need to use objects or other data types as identifiers, consider using a unique string representation (like a UUID) as the array key.

```php
// Instead of using objects directly as keys:
$obj = new stdClass();
$arr[$obj] = 'value'; // Problematic

// Use a string representation or UUID:
$uuid = uniqid();
$arr[$uuid] = 'value'; //Correct

// Or use an associative array structure that maps the object to a value.
$arr = [];
$arr[$obj] = ['value' => 'the_value'];
```
By consistently using string or integer keys, you avoid the ambiguity and potential for unexpected behavior associated with PHP's loose type handling of array keys.
